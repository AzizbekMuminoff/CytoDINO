# 🔬 CytoDINO: Bone Marrow Cell Classification model based on DinoV3

A computationally efficient approach to bone marrow cell classification achieving **state-of-the-art results** on the MLL dataset by fine-tuning DINOv3 with LoRA adapters.

## Highlights

- **SOTA Performance**: 87.7% Weighted F1, 75.4% Macro F1 — outperforming DAGDNet* and DinoBloom
- **Efficient Fine-tuning**: LoRA injection enables training on consumer GPUs with only ~5-8% trainable parameters
- **Biologically-Informed Loss**: Custom hierarchical label smoothing respecting cell lineage relationships
- **Clinical Safety**: Critical error penalty to minimize dangerous misclassifications (e.g., blast to normal)

## Method

### Architecture
We fine-tune **DINOv3-ViT-L** (~300mln parameters) using **LoRA**, keeping the backbone frozen while injecting trainable adapters into all linear layers. A lightweight **Transformer Decoder Head** aggregates patch features for classification.

### Key Innovations

**1. Hierarchical Label Smoothing**

Instead of uniform label smoothing, we distribute smoothing mass based on biological cell lineages:

```
Granulocytic: BLA → PMO → MYB → MMZ → NGB → NGS
Erythroid:    PEB → EBO
Lymphoid:     LYI → LYT → PLM
```

Misclassifications within the same lineage receive higher smoothing weight, with adjacent maturation stages receiving additional bonus. This guides the model to make "biologically reasonable" errors.

**2. Critical Error Penalty**

We apply a 3× loss multiplier when the model misclassifies critical cells (blasts, promyelocytes, faggot cells, etc.) as benign cells. This reduces clinically dangerous false negatives.

**3. Balanced Oversampling**

Class-weighted sampling with inverse frequency weighting (power 0.7) addresses the severe class imbalance (e.g., 8 abnormal eosinophils vs 5,884 segmented neutrophils).
